A testing bed

## Todo:

-   [Annotate the graph with the word type (using something like NLTK)]
    -   Used Lemmas- see how that goes
-   Optimize semantic enrichment to work live
-   [Add a way to export the graph to a file (probably JSON format)]
-   [Create a Javascript frontend to visualize the graph]
