## Todo:

-   Optimize semantic enrichment to work live
    -   In progress
    -   NEED: work on a text workhorse function. the function should take text- and unilaterally extract word, sentence, and other info. it should return when sentences end, along with those words that were given. can be modified to return lemmas, pos, embeddings, etc., but this shouldn't be default. default should give the words, sentences, paragraphs, and where they end to be used for live embedding.
-   [Add a way to export the graph to a file (probably JSON format)]
    -   DONE
-   [Create a Javascript frontend to visualize the graph]Meow Parlour
